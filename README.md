# Main Branch Requirements
To ensure proper documentation and project tracking, the Main branch must include a Word document titled "ANNEX 1 PDD (SOP Product development)" 
(C:\Users\fgrau\kdc one Development Corporation, Inc\R&I - Research & Innovation NPD - Documents\0. Technical manager\SOPs\SOP Technical Product Development). 
This document should serve as the project's foundation and include information about concepts, Critical Operation Points (COP), related studies, the Design Verification Plan (DVP), links to reports, and final approval.

By maintaining this document in the main branch, we ensure transparency, traceability, and clear communication among team members and reviewers.
